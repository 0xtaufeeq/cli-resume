# CLI Resume

So, you‚Äôre ready to take your resume game to the next level? Cool, because this CLI Resume project does just that. No boring PDFs or generic templates. This is a dynamic, animated terminal experience that screams, *‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not your average candidate.‚Äù*

## Why Build This?

Because why not? Think about it, you're a dev. Your resume can be more than a list of jobs and skills; it can *be* the proof of those skills. This project lets you showcase your achievements in a way that's functional, creative, and uniquely *you*. Plus, it‚Äôs fun to build (and even more fun to flex lol).
